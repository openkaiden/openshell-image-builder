# Sandbox Policy

How the sandbox policy is assembled, what each section means, and how to add or modify rules.

## Description

Every built image contains `/etc/openshell/policy.yaml`. The openshell runtime reads it at startup to configure filesystem access, the user the agent runs as, and which network endpoints each binary is allowed to reach.

The final policy is assembled by `build_policy()` in `src/main.rs` by merging three sources:

1. **Base policy** — `assets/policy.yaml`, committed to the repo. Contains filesystem and process config, plus baseline network rules shared by all images (git, gh CLI).
2. **Inference fragment** — returned by `Inference::policy_yaml(agent_binary, base_url)`. Adds network rules for the LLM backend. Only included when both `--agent` and `--inference` are given (the method needs the agent binary path to scope the rule).
3. **Agent fragment** — returned by `Agent::policy_yaml()`. Adds agent-specific network rules (e.g., Claude needs `platform.claude.com` for telemetry). Only included if the string is non-empty.

## YAML schema

The full schema is modelled in `src/policy/mod.rs` (all structs use `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` — unknown keys cause a parse error).

### Top-level sections

```yaml
version: 1

filesystem_policy:          # what paths the agent can read/write
  include_workdir: true
  read_only:  [/usr, /lib, /proc, /dev/urandom, /app, /etc, /var/log]
  read_write: [/sandbox, /tmp, /dev/null]

landlock:
  compatibility: best_effort

process:
  run_as_user:  sandbox
  run_as_group: sandbox

network_policies:           # keyed map — key is the merge slug
  <slug>:
    name: <display-name>
    endpoints: [...]
    binaries:  [...]
```

Only `version` and `network_policies` are required. The other three sections are optional and only appear in the base policy.

### Network endpoint fields

```yaml
endpoints:
  - host: api.example.com     # hostname; wildcards accepted ("*-aiplatform.googleapis.com")
    port: 443                 # single port; use `ports` for a list
    ports: [80, 443]          # alternative to `port` — covers all listed ports
    protocol: rest            # rest | grpc | ssh | (omit for any)
    tls: terminate            # terminate | passthrough | (omit)
    enforcement: enforce      # enforce | audit | (omit)
    access: full              # full | read-only | (omit)
    rules:                    # optional L7 allow-list (REST only)
      - allow:
          method: GET
          path: "/**/info/refs*"
      - allow:
          method: POST
          path: "/**/git-upload-pack"
```

Omitting a field means "any value is allowed for that dimension". A rule with only `host` and `port` allows all methods and paths.

### Binary scoping

```yaml
binaries:
  - { path: /sandbox/.local/bin/claude }
```

The rule only applies when the connecting process's binary matches one of these paths. The runtime resolves the path via `/proc/{pid}/exe` and walks the ancestor tree.

## How fragments are merged

`build_policy()` in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
let mut sandbox_policy = policy::parse_sandbox_policy(base_yaml)?;

if let (Some(inference), Some(agent)) = (inference, agent) {
    let fragment = policy::parse_sandbox_policy(&inference.policy_yaml(agent.binary_path(), base_url))?;
    sandbox_policy.network_policies.extend(fragment.network_policies);
}

if let Some(agent) = agent {
    let fragment_yaml = agent.policy_yaml();
    if !fragment_yaml.is_empty() {
        let fragment = policy::parse_sandbox_policy(fragment_yaml)?;
        sandbox_policy.network_policies.extend(fragment.network_policies);
    }
}
```

`network_policies` is a `BTreeMap<String, NetworkPolicyRule>`. The BTreeMap key is the merge slug (e.g. `"anthropic"`, `"claude_code"`). `extend()` means: if a fragment uses a slug that already exists in the base, the base entry is silently replaced. The `name` field inside the rule is separate — it is what the runtime displays, and should match the slug by convention.

**Merge order**: base → inference → agent. An agent rule can therefore override a base or inference rule with the same slug.

## Existing network rules

| Slug | Source | Allowed endpoints | Scoped to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `github_ssh_over_https` | base | `github.com:443` (git smart HTTP read-only) | `/usr/bin/git` |
| `github_rest_api` | base | `api.github.com:443` (read-only) | `/usr/bin/gh` |
| `anthropic` | AnthropicInference | `api.anthropic.com:443`, `statsig.anthropic.com:443` (or custom endpoint) | agent binary |
| `vertexai` | VertexAiInference | `oauth2.googleapis.com:443`, `aiplatform.googleapis.com:443`, `*-aiplatform.googleapis.com:443` | agent binary |
| `ollama` | OllamaInference | `host.openshell.internal:11434` (or custom host:port) | agent binary |
| `claude_code` | ClaudeAgent | `raw.githubusercontent.com:443`, `platform.claude.com:443`, `api.github.com:443` (read-only) | `/sandbox/.local/bin/claude` |

## Where to make changes

### Modify the base policy (`assets/policy.yaml`)

Add, remove, or edit entries under `network_policies`. The slug (YAML key) must be unique across the whole merged document. Do not add unknown YAML fields — the parser rejects them.

Example: allow `curl` to reach an internal registry:

```yaml
network_policies:
  internal_registry:
    name: internal-registry
    endpoints:
      - { host: registry.internal.example.com, port: 443 }
    binaries:
      - { path: /usr/bin/curl }
```

Unit test in `src/policy/mod.rs` — add a `round_trip_*` test to confirm the new entry survives parse → serialize → re-parse.

### Modify an inference policy rule (`src/inference/<provider>.rs`)

Edit the `policy_yaml()` method. The fragment must be a valid policy document (starts with `version: 1`, contains `network_policies:`). The slug must not collide with base policy slugs.

If the provider supports `--endpoint`, the method receives `base_url: Some(url)` and should parse it with `super::parse_host_port` instead of using the hardcoded default:

```rust
fn policy_yaml(&self, agent_binary: &str, base_url: Option<&str>) -> String {
    let (host, port) = base_url
        .and_then(super::parse_host_port)
        .unwrap_or_else(|| ("api.example.com".to_string(), 443));
    format!(r#"version: 1
network_policies:
  myprovider:
    name: myprovider
    endpoints:
      - {{ host: {host}, port: {port}, protocol: rest, enforcement: enforce, access: full, tls: terminate }}
    binaries:
      - {{ path: {agent_binary} }}
"#)
}
```

Remember: this fragment is only included when both agent and inference are selected.

### Add or modify an agent policy rule (`src/agent/<agent>.rs`)

Override `policy_yaml()` on the `Agent` impl. Return an empty string if no agent-level rules are needed (the default). The method returns `&str` (a string literal), not `String`:

```rust
fn policy_yaml(&self) -> &str {
    r#"version: 1
network_policies:
  myagent_telemetry:
    name: myagent-telemetry
    endpoints:
      - { host: telemetry.myagent.example.com, port: 443 }
    binaries:
      - { path: /sandbox/.myagent/bin/myagent }
"#
}
```

Unlike the inference rule, the binary path is hardcoded here (it is the agent's own binary, which does not change per-inference).

## Testing policy changes

### Unit tests

**`src/policy/mod.rs`** — test that a new entry round-trips correctly:

```rust
#[test]
fn new_rule_round_trips() {
    let yaml = "version: 1\nnetwork_policies:\n  myrule:\n    name: my-rule\n    endpoints:\n      - { host: example.com, port: 443 }\n    binaries:\n      - { path: /usr/bin/curl }\n";
    let p = parse_sandbox_policy(yaml).expect("parse");
    let out = serialize_sandbox_policy(&p).expect("serialize");
    let p2 = parse_sandbox_policy(&out).expect("re-parse");
    assert_eq!(p2.network_policies["myrule"].name, "my-rule");
}
```

**`src/main.rs`** — test that `build_policy()` produces the expected output:

```rust
#[test]
fn build_policy_with_myprovider_inference_includes_expected_host() {
    let yaml = build_policy(
        BASE_POLICY_YAML,
        Some(&agent::ClaudeAgent),
        Some(&inference::MyProviderInference),
        None,
    ).unwrap();
    assert!(yaml.contains("api.myprovider.com"));
}
```

**`src/agent/<agent>.rs` or `src/inference/<provider>.rs`** — test the raw YAML string returned by `policy_yaml()`:

```rust
#[test]
fn policy_yaml_has_myrule_name() {
    assert!(MyAgent.policy_yaml().contains("name: myagent-telemetry"));
}

#[test]
fn policy_yaml_has_expected_host() {
    assert!(MyAgent.policy_yaml().contains("telemetry.myagent.example.com"));
}
```

### Integration test

Inspect the policy in the built image:

```sh
podman run --rm openshell-test-ubuntu-claude:integration -c "cat /etc/openshell/policy.yaml"
```

Or use the integration test check helpers — they read `/etc/openshell/policy.yaml` and assert on specific `name:` values:

```sh
# run just the policy tests for a specific image combination
cargo test --test integration_test ubuntu_claude::policy -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
```

## Common mistakes

- **Unknown YAML field** — adding a field not in `src/policy/mod.rs` causes `parse_sandbox_policy` to return an error. The build will fail with a deserialisation error. Check the struct definitions in `src/policy/mod.rs` before adding new fields.
- **Duplicate slug** — if your fragment uses the same BTreeMap key as an existing rule (including base policy slugs), it silently replaces it. Use a unique slug, or intentionally replace a base rule.
- **Inference fragment omitted** — if a user runs with `--inference` but no `--agent`, the inference network rule is not added (the merge requires both). This is by design: the rule must name a binary, and there is no agent binary without an agent.
- **Empty agent policy** — returning an empty string from `Agent::policy_yaml()` is valid and means no agent-level rule. Returning a malformed YAML string causes the build to fail with a parse error.
